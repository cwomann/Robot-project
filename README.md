# Robot-project

This project consists of the development of a robot from scratch. The design started with the selection of all its components throw the software implementation. To allow the establishment of a starting point and gathering the indispensable knowledge for
the robot prototype development, initial research work has been carried out.

After researching and validating the solutions found, the prototype was assembled, and the required algorithms have been implemented. Finally, validation and functionalities check tests were performed to optimize the developed prototype. The autonomous movement of the robot, herein developed, is based on an anti-collision system, which allows the robot to navigate on a surface without human control.

The remote mode has been implemented through the design of a Web page connected to a server deployed into on the development board.
